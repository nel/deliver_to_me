	Rewriting emails through environment file is not that practical in multi developer environments, so I implements targets
	Targets are just scripts that return a list of emails. Implemented target right now is :current_git_user_email, it returns git config user.email
	as the recipients of the emails. Very practical during development with git scm. You could also implement a target to look for email in a yml file I.E.

	first release, rewrite to cc and bcc, but you need to specify the emails to be used in the environments file
